# 💳 Simple Banking System (C++ Console App)

This is a basic console-based banking system implemented in C++ using a singly linked list for user account management. It allows users to register, log in, and perform simple banking operations like deposit, withdraw, and balance inquiry.

## 📋 Features

- User registration (Full name, username, password)
- Login authentication
- Deposit and withdraw money
- Check account balance
- Data stored using a custom linked list structure

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C++
- Linked List (Custom implementation)
- Console I/O

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Upon launching the program, users are presented with a main menu:
   - Register a new account
   - Log in to an existing account
   - Exit the program

2. After logging in, users can:
   - Deposit money
   - Withdraw money
   - View their current balance

3. User data is stored in memory using a linked list (no file/database persistence).

## 📌 Limitations

- Data is not persistent; all information is lost when the program closes.
- No input validation or password encryption.
- Not suitable for production use — intended for learning purposes only.
